# ATTENTION #

** THIS CODE STYLE IS NOT A REFLECTION OF MY SKILLS AS A PROGRAMMER, it is a reflection of working around the clock on the assignment 48 hours before it was due. A lot of code vomit. It works, but it's NOT good.**

Note: When I have time, I will go through and refactor this code to reflect good programming practices, clean code, and more efficient concurrency design.
